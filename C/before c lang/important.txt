The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools for developing and running .NET applications. It includes the MSBuild build engine, the Roslyn (C# and Visual Basic) compiler, and the F# compiler. Most commands are run by using the dotnet command. The CLI tools can be used for local development and continuous integration.

code editor vs editor vs compiler vs interpreter vs IDE

editor the place that you put code on it find only the syntax error not ran time errors

IDE ===> environment of coding includ ( compiler - interpreter - code editor - else) visual studio & code blocks no need to install sdk

code editor ==> only (editor - compiler - interpreter) no more futures more lite   vs code need to install sdk
====================================================================================
in farst run  code :

compiler ===> review all the code first than compile it to machien code if there an run time error he stop and didn't compile the code 

interpreter ====> more faster compile first and if he face any error he stop compiling   and show whare is the error in the code

in secound run if you did not change the code :

compiler ===> faster : show you the result faster because he build it in the first run ------ compiler give to computer all structure that pc need and make it save acopy of it if run again same cod you did not need compiler again 

interpreter ====> slow : the result slower becouse he rebuild the code again every time you run it ------ interepreter did not leave a copy fo stucture to the pc ,pc need interpreted in every run (python)
